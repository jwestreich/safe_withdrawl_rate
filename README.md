# Probabilistic Forecasting to Assess Validity of 4% Withdrawl Rule for Retirement

Some late night in college, I fell down a YouTube rabbit hole about [FIRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement). FIRE stands for Financially Independent, Retire Early. The idea goes like this: sacrifice as much as you can when you start working in order to save and invest as much money as you can as quickly as possible; figure out how much money you would like to live on annually in retirement; save/invest until you have 25x that amount; stop working; withdraw only 4% of your savings each year, and you should be able to safely have a 30-year retirement. This idea has had validity in the personal finance community for several years because of some analysis of stock market trends over the past several decades. It has been demonstrated that there has *never* been a 30-year period where this would have failed. Even if you stopped working at the peak of the market, right before a crash, and consistently only withdrew 4% of your savings each year, you would have enough money to last 30 years.

While this analysis used methods that I'm sure the original creators of it believed was sound, there has been one significant limitation: the analysis is deterministic, instead of probabilistic. These methods assume that the stock market in the future will move in the exact same ways that they have in the past. While the past is informative of the future, it is not the future itself. Instead, the analysis in this repository is probabilitic: the past performance of the stock market is used to create many different simulations of what the future stock market could do. With enough simulations, a probability of success can be calculated for the 4% withdrawl rule, as well as some variants and changing some assumptions.
